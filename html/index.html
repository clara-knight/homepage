				<h2 id=about_header>About me</h2>
				<p class=about_text>
				I am Clara Knight and I am a pure math student at the University
				of California, Los Angeles. My academic goals are in machine
				learning and its applications to biochemistry, and proteins and RNA
				in particular. Don't ask me about AGI or gen-AI.
				My interest was spurred by AlphaGo and I like autonomous agents.
				</p>
				<p class=about_text>
				Due to funding cuts to research I am strenghtening my software 
				development skills but I would love to become Dr. Knight some day.
				Portfolio page coming soon.
				I like C, C++, jq, Matlab, Python, and R.
				Let's read papers together.
				</p>
				<p class=about_text>
				Besides core lower division math, I have taken lower division 
				biology, one year of organic chemistry, economics, and data science.
				I like algebra, game theory, and axiomatic set theory.
				Currently interested in time series analysis.
				I can do organic syntheses and run and interpret instrumental analysis
				on the results. I'm familiar with basic biology lab techniques.
				</p>
				<p class=about_text>
				I am a non-traditional student: I transferred from East Los Angeles
				College in Monterey Park. 
				Prior to that, I worked in operations in airline catering until I
				automated most of my job in VBA and Excel, and applied to college
				because I had no more room for growth. Even further back,
				I was a butcher in Santa Cruz county, and before that I grew up in Mexico.
				</p>
				<p class=about_text>
				In the former I ensured the LAX flights of the 2nd largest airline in
				the world had breakfast in the morning and lunch if they got delayed.
				When AS flight 1282 resulted in the grounding of Boeing 737s worldwide,
				I was responsible for fixing the catering paperwork of the planes
				that flew in their place.
				</p>
				<p class=about_text>
				In the latter I climbed from meat clerk to assistant meat manager
				and on a good day I cut 2,000-6,000 lb of meat (beef and pork)
				and didn't talk to a single customer because none complained.
				Most days were good. 
				In between I stacked fruits at Erewhon, and they let me eat the ones
				I dropped, as a little treat.
				<p class=about_text>
				I like to eat and cook, and in 2022 I went to Rome on a whim to eat, drink,
				and walk through museums. I don't read as often as I should, but modern
				and post-modern literature are my childhood loves.
